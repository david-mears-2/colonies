# Resources bees collect

## Nectar

To make honey. Collected from flowers and stored in the honey stomach. It's processed into honey at the hive. It serves as the primary food source.

### Honey

Nectar is stored as honey for later eating in times of dearth such as winter or when foraging isn't possible.

## Pollen

'For protein'. Gathered in pockets on hind legs. Vital for feeding larvae. Mixed with nectar to create 'bee bread' which is stored in cells. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bee_pollen) says this is primary food source, and "During collection and possibly packing, the pollen is mixed with nectar and bee salivary secretions". 

## Water

For:
* Hive cooling
* Honey dilution for larvae
* Maintain optimal humidity in the hive
* Dissolve crystallized honey

## Plant resins and tree sap

To make propolis for sealing the hive. Collected from tree buds and bark. They mix these sticky substances with wax to create propolis. Defence against robbing increases the game-importance of sap collection.

## Wax

For building honeycomb (which serves as storage space, nursery, or living space). Not really a resource since bees make it with their bodies, but "wax production is quite resource-intensive - bees need to consume about 8 pounds of honey to produce 1 pound of wax"

## Other resources

I like having a variety of resources in the game I think, because each could lend itself to a different strategy? 

### Sub-types of pollen

"Without a *diverse* source of high-quality pollen, a colony will collapse". Perhaps pollen diversity affects lifespan of members of the hive. The colour of pollen / bee bread varies based on the flower focused on. Different pollens provide varied protein profiles, amino acids, lipids, and vitamins necessary for complete nutrition.

### Micro-resources (plant compounds)

There are various micro resources that bees use to defend against microbes and parasites. These could function like ‘bonus’ extra resource types in the game (kind of like how AoE relics do) that perhaps work by increasing bee lifespan or by acting against specific diseases. This encourages players to seek out a diversity of flowers / care about the specific makeup of different flowers. Source: https://claude.ai/chat/99d004c5-e47c-4f9b-ac50-0ea4b4dd1e06

- Thymol, menthol, essential oils [from plants like thyme, oregano, mint, eucalyptus] have antimicrobial properties
- Alkaloids [from plants like poppy, nightshade family], help reduce parasite loads
- Polyphenols and flavonoids [from plants like sunflower, willow, various fruits] have antioxidants, good for immune systems
- Terpenes [from pine, spruce, and many flowering plants] have antimicrobial benefits
- Phytosterols [from various pollens] aid in bee development.
- Quercetin and other flavonols [from many flowering plants] good.
- Eugenol from cloves and cinnamon has both antimicrobial and mite-repellent properties
- Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) from poplar buds has potent antifungal properties that help fight chalkbrood disease

Some beekeepers now plant "bee pharmacies" with medicinal plants like thyme, mint, eucalyptus, and sunflowers near apiaries to provide these beneficial compounds.

Bees seem to selectively forage on certain plants when colonies are under pathogen stress. Not sure if the game should model changing pathogen stress over time or just leave it to lifespan.

## Carrying capacity by resource

> a honey bee can carry up to 70 milligrams of nectar in a single trip, while it can only carry up to 25 milligrams of pollen or 40 milligrams of water.

# Types of bee

'caste' seems to be a more overarching term since there are only 3 castes.

The type of bee that a larvae becomes is determined (in part?) by the diet it is given. This certainly applies to winter bees and queens. But note that some specialisms are a matter of a bee's _age_.
I think a larva develops in a matter of days.
There are specialised sub-types of workers and of foragers.
There are 'winter bees' which are fatter, and which can live up to 6 months, where as a normal bee lives for about 6 weeks.
Foragers dedicate themselves to foraging from one type of a flower at a time. The colour of pollen / bee bread varies based on the flower focused on.

## Worker bee lifecycle

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey_bee#Life_cycle

- Nurse bee: cleans hive, feeds larvae using royal jelly from their glands (larvae later eat other stuff)
- Then, onto building comb cells. [Claude says middle-aged workers produce wax, build comb, store food, guard the entrance]
- Then, they do other in-colony tasks, including receiving deliveries from foragers, and guarding the hive.
- Graduate into a forager. Foragers communicate using dances.

There is a coarse-grained distinction among workers between 'house bees' (stage 1-3) and foragers.

"This division of labor isn't completely rigid though - bees can adapt and change roles based on colony needs and conditions."

## Appearance

Apparently it's visible to the human eye when a bee is laden with pollen.

## robbers, guards

When hives get desperate, they may turn to robbing honey from other hives. (Check if 'robber bee' is a specialised type.) For protection from this and
other intruders (from ants to mice to bears), hives station guard bees at the entrances. When an alarm is sounded (by pheromone), the whole hive may
turn into guard bees for defence. Hives also tend to have small entrances to minimise the investment in guards.

Defence against robbing increases the game-importance of sap collection. Guidance to beekeepers reads "Be vigilant and take steps to prevent robbing, such as closing up any cracks or gaps in the hives" and this can be re-purposed as player advice.

### "silent robbing"

Bees can mask their scents. "Silent robbing" occurs when robber bees learn to move slowly and adopt the chemical signature of the target hive. This allows them to bypass guards and steal resources without triggering an alarm response - essentially infiltrating rather than invading.

## 'honey-bound'

Is the term for when a hive gets too full of honey. Bees just keep on delivering honey/nectar, reducing the space available for the queen to lay eggs, and their instinctual response to the state of being honey-bound is to 'swarm' (split into separate hive).

# Fighting (low-level)

> The barbed stinger serves a crucial purpose for the worker bee: it allows her to defend the hive, but at the cost of her own life.

Head-butt or grapple
Bite
Release alarm pheromones to call reinforcements [implying that a valid low-level fighting strategy is outnumbering]

# Fighting (high-level)

Irl, bees can stage full-scale hive invasions, where one colony tries to take over another, to gain control of honey stores or the whole hive.

Or they can do 'usurpation swarms, where a small swarm with a queen will enter an established colony, kill the resident queen, and take over the workforce and resources. This is different from traditional robbing as the goal is to capture the entire colony infrastructure.

Resource blockades sometimes form when bees from a stronger colony will hover around the entrance of a weaker hive, preventing foragers from returning with nectar and pollen. This weakens the target colony over time without direct confrontation. When foragers from the weaker colony return with nectar or pollen, the blockading bees will intercept them and either:

- Physically harass them, causing them to drop their loads
- Force them to land and surrender their nectar
- Chase them away from their own hive entrance

So it mostly works by preventing the resources from getting back to the hive, weakening the hive over time! So it's a good early attack strategy, preparing the ground for later attacks.

Note, chatgpt says they can also blockade resources: https://chatgpt.com/c/67b60a23-f900-8013-8ef6-439abae87ddb and even without direct competition that bees may 'patrol the area', chase competitors.

## Usurpation swarm steps

https://claude.ai/chat/0e03bc83-808b-4d65-bfa0-bc92176e201e

1. The invading queen and her workers enter the target hive gradually, often during periods when guard bees are less vigilant (like during rainy weather or evening hours).
1. They may initially hide in peripheral areas of the hive while slowly acquiring the colony's scent.
1. When the usurping queen kills the resident queen, there's a brief period of confusion among the resident workers.
1. The usurping queen then begins releasing her own queen pheromones throughout the hive. These pheromones are remarkably powerful—they inhibit worker ovary development, regulate worker behavior, and essentially "reprogram" the colony.
1. Within just 1-2 days of the resident queen's death, the worker bees accept the new queen primarily because they respond to the presence of queen pheromones, not to the specific identity of their queen.
1. The combined workforce (invaders plus original residents) then functions as a single colony under the new leadership.


# Swarming: the hive splits up if runs out of room

# Seasonality

76% of new colonies in some sample died in their first winter (mostly due to starvation) - Honeybee Democracy

Seems like the game could easily incorporate a seasonality element, given the existence of winter bees (see 'types of bee'). This would encourage
play styles where you have to make sure you bank enough honey to survive the winter.
See blog post from wildflowermeadow.com about the differences between seasons.

Weather can affect things, via affecting the amount of pollen available. Or I suppose foraging could be rained off.

There are complex effects of seasonality:
> Pollen is only available during certain times of the year, and it is not always available in large quantities
> Water is also not always available, especially in dry climates.
> Nectar, on the other hand, is available year-round and in most climates.

So a rainstorm is bad in the immediate term, because it rains off foraging, but good in the longer term, because it creates pools for bees to collect water from, and it encourages flowers to grow.

# Queen death

> In response to the queen’s demise, the worker bees initiate the emergency queen rearing process. They select a few worker bee larvae, typically between five and eight days old, and begin feeding them royal jelly, a special nutrient-rich food that is typically reserved for the queen. This special diet stimulates the larvae’s development and transforms them into potential queens.
> In some cases, the emergency queen rearing process may fail, and the colony may become queenless. In these situations, beekeeper intervention may be necessary to save the hive.

# Interesting

book 'Honeybee Democracy' makes the point that a hive full of bees and a human brain weigh about the same, and there are similarities between how neuron firings and bee stuff are the underlying agents that make up decision-making (both situations involve meeting a threshold)

A colony can be viewed as a superorganism or as a society. Superorganism view might promote a more coarse-grained, automatic, groupy level of player control over the hive; society view more fine-grained. If we use the former way of doing things, then the game could even be called Superorganism.

Also from this book I learn that shortly after winter solstice hives begin to lay eggs again (into the spaces left by used up honey). So there is an interesting strategy question for players to work out of when to start paying down their honey stores in order to 'get a head start' for the next year's competition.

# Waggle dances

Dances involve 'followers' who join in the dance.
The information dances encode are:
- The resource in question (which receiving bees pick up by smelling the dancer with their antennae, who I think does a little vomit or something to pass on the scent)
- The approximate direction of the resource
- The approximate distance (directionally proportional to the duration of the waggle phase)
Once at the location, recruited foragers then search about for the described bounty.

# Other species of bees for future game expansion

It would be fun to have the player select a bee 'tribe' (in the biological sense) simply for the collision (cross-pollination?) with the concept of a 'civilisation' as in AoE2.

"The only other domesticated [Apis] bee is the eastern honey bee (Apis cerana), which occurs in South, Southeast, and East Asia [...] some other [non-Apis] types of bees produce and store honey and have been kept by humans for that purpose, including the stingless bees belonging to the genus Melipona and the Indian stingless or dammar bee Tetragonula iridipennis." Then there's 'Africanized honey bees' also known as killer bees. 

The group of 'corbiculate' (pollen-basket-having) bees has four big subgroups: honey bees (Apini tribe), orchid bees (Euglossini), bumblebees (Bombini), and stingless bees (Meliponini). Then there's "Bee species with no pollen baskets have scopae, which fulfil a similar role" - not sure if any such bees are eusocial.

## Meliponini tribe (500 species) / Melipona genus (70 species)

The main honey-producing bees of this group generally belong to the genera Scaptotrigona, Tetragonisca, Melipona and Austroplebeia

NB Winston & Michener indicate that eusociality has arisen independently in the Apinae and Meliponinae

"Meliponines, considered highly eusocial insects, exhibit a remarkable caste division [having soldiers as a caste as well as the other things honeybees have]" and create cerumen to build their hives.

"Ripening concentrates the nectar and increases the sugar content, though it is not nearly as concentrated as the honey from Apis mellifera. [...] Stingless bee honeys differ from A. mellifera honey in terms of color, texture, and flavor, being more liquid with a higher water content. Rich in minerals, amino acids, and flavonoid compounds, the composition of honey varies among colonies of the same species, influenced by factors such as season, habitat, and collected resources."

"Stingless bees, as a collective group, display remarkable adaptability to diverse nesting sites. They can be found in exposed nests in trees, from living in ant and termite nests above and below ground to cavities in trees, trunks, branches, rocks, or even human constructions."

### Exposed nests

"Notably, certain species, such as the African Dactylurina, construct hanging nests from the undersides of large branches for protection against adverse weather conditions. Additionally, some American Trigona species, including T. corvina, T. spinipes, and T. nigerrima, as well as Tetragonisca weyrauchi, build fully exposed nests."

"A significant minority of meliponine species, belonging to genera like Camargoia, Geotrigona, Melipona, Mourella, Nogueirapis, Paratrigona, Partamona, Schwarziana, and others, opt for ground nests. These species take advantage of cavities in the ground, often utilizing abandoned nests of ants, termites, or rodents." "The majority of stingless bees favor nesting in pre-existing cavities within tree trunks or branches."

### Different brooding behaviour.

In Apis colonies, queens lay eggs into reusable empty cells, which are then progressively provisioned over several days before final sealing. But Mellipona have a practice of "mass provisioning"

### Swarming

Unlike honey bees, stingless bee colonies are unable to perform absconding - a term denoting the abandonment of the nest and migration to a new location - making them reliant on alternative strategies to cope with challenges

### Fighting

Unlike other eusocial bees, they do not sting, but will defend by biting if their nest is disturbed.

### Defense tactics

They use camouflage and mimicry to blend into their surroundings or imitate other animals to avoid detection.

Nest entrance guards play a vital role in colony defense by actively preventing unauthorized entry through attacking intruders and releasing alarm pheromones to recruit additional defenders. It is worth noting that nest guards often carry sticky substances, such as resins and wax, in their corbiculae or mandibles. Stingless bees apply substances to attackers to immobilise them, thus thwarting potential threats to the colony. Some species (Tetragonisca angustula and Nannotrigona testaceicornis, for example) also close their nest entrances with a soft and porous layer of cerumen at night, further enhancing colony security during vulnerable periods.

## Bumble bee (Bombus) - 250 species

The colonies are smaller than those of honey bees, growing to as few as 50 individuals in a nest. (50-400 usually, compared to 50,000 for honeybee hives.) "Compared to honey bees and carpenter bees, bumblebees have the lowest chill-coma temperature."

The largest bumblebee species in the world is B. dahlbomii of Chile, up to about 40 mm (1.6 in) long, and described as "flying mice" and "a monstrous fluffy ginger beast"

### Advantage 1 over other tribes

Bumblebees are active under conditions during which honeybees and other smaller bees stay at home, and can readily absorb heat from even weak sunshine.

### Advantage 2

Unlike in honeybees, a bumblebee's stinger lacks barbs, so the bee can sting repeatedly without leaving the stinger in the wound and thereby injuring itself.

### Disadvantage 1

No sophisticated waggle dances, convey less information:

> Bumblebees do not exhibit the "bee dances" used by honeybees to tell other workers the locations of food sources. Instead, when they return from a successful foraging expedition, they run excitedly around in the nest for several minutes before going out to forage once more. These bees may be offering some form of communication based on the buzzing sounds made by their wings, which may stimulate other bees to start foraging.

### Disadvantage 2

Unlike honeybees, bumblebees only store a few days' worth of food, so are much more vulnerable to food shortages.

### Nest

A bumblebee nest is not organised into hexagonal combs like that of a honeybee; the cells are instead clustered together untidily. ... Nests in temperate regions last only for a single season and do not survive the winter.

### Winter diapause

The drones and workers die as the weather turns colder; the young queens feed intensively to build up stores of fat for the winter. They survive in a resting state (diapause) [kinda hibernation], generally below ground, until the weather warms up in the spring. The common UK species 'early bumblebee' is among the earliest to come out, in Feb.

### Workers and queens compete to lay eggs

Because of the reproductive competition between workers and the queen, bumblebees are considered "primitively eusocial".

### Scent communication feature, not sure if unique to bumblebees

In at least some species, once a bumblebee has visited a flower, it leaves a scent mark on it. This scent mark deters bumblebees from visiting that flower until the scent degrades. [...] they learn to use this bouquet to identify both rewarding and unrewarding flowers

## The Euglossines (Euglossini - 200 species)

They are green! (And a few other colours - glossy.) Really long tongues.

Five genera: Euglossa, Eulaema, Eufriesea, Exaerete and the monotypic Aglae. These last two are kleptoparasitical only.

They collect mud (I think another tribe was mentioned to collect clay) for building.

Their tongues, measuring up to 4 cm (1.6 inches) in some species, are used to access deep, narrow flower structures, some of which can only be reached by euglossines.

Only some of the euglossini are eusocial. Wasn't quite able to determine the maximum extent of this from the 'Sociality' section of https://www.jstor.org/stable/2097073, but the 'Discussion' section includes this info:

> Eufriesa often form aggregations, but the cluster of nests can scarcely be called a colony. Those Euglossa species that build aerial nests
are solitary, though perhaps secondarily so. The cordata and purpurea
species groups of Euglossa appear communal, with siblings, as far as
known, working on independent clusters of cells. *Euglossa intersecta and
the piliventris species group, like Eulaema, are clearly communal, and
possibly even quasisocial, though the evidence for this is sparse*.

This might be the most social species: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euglossa_cordata#Colony_cycle


### An advantage

They fly faster. https://www.jstor.org/stable/2097073

### A disadvantage

Being adapted to the tropics I'm sure northerly climes would kill them in winter. So maybe they need to be overpowered so they have a compensatory 
advantage so they can plausibly win before winter... I guess the fact they fly faster could mean they could be billed overall as a 'quick' tribe: quick-flying and relying on quick-winning.
