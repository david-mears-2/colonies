# Resources bees collect

## Nectar

To make honey. Collected from flowers and stored in the honey stomach. It's processed into honey at the hive. It serves as the primary food source.

### Honey

Nectar is stored as honey for later eating in times of dearth such as winter or when foraging isn't possible.

## Pollen

'For protein'. Gathered in pockets on hind legs. Vital for feeding larvae. Mixed with nectar to create 'bee bread' which is stored in cells. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bee_pollen) says this is primary food source, and "During collection and possibly packing, the pollen is mixed with nectar and bee salivary secretions". 

## Water

For:
* Hive cooling
* Honey dilution for larvae
* Maintain optimal humidity in the hive
* Dissolve crystallized honey

## Plant resins and tree sap

To make propolis for sealing the hive. Collected from tree buds and bark. They mix these sticky substances with wax to create propolis. Defence against robbing increases the game-importance of sap collection.

## Wax

For building honeycomb (which serves as storage space, nursery, or living space). Not really a resource since bees make it with their bodies, but "wax production is quite resource-intensive - bees need to consume about 8 pounds of honey to produce 1 pound of wax"

## Other resources

I like having a variety of resources in the game I think, because each could lend itself to a different strategy? 

### Sub-types of pollen

"Without a *diverse* source of high-quality pollen, a colony will collapse". Perhaps pollen diversity affects lifespan of members of the hive. The colour of pollen / bee bread varies based on the flower focused on. Different pollens provide varied protein profiles, amino acids, lipids, and vitamins necessary for complete nutrition.

### Micro-resources (plant compounds)

There are various micro resources that bees use to defend against microbes and parasites. These could function like ‘bonus’ extra resource types in the game (kind of like how AoE relics do) that perhaps work by increasing bee lifespan or by acting against specific diseases. This encourages players to seek out a diversity of flowers / care about the specific makeup of different flowers. Source: https://claude.ai/chat/99d004c5-e47c-4f9b-ac50-0ea4b4dd1e06

- Thymol, menthol, essential oils [from plants like thyme, oregano, mint, eucalyptus] have antimicrobial properties
- Alkaloids [from plants like poppy, nightshade family], help reduce parasite loads
- Polyphenols and flavonoids [from plants like sunflower, willow, various fruits] have antioxidants, good for immune systems
- Terpenes [from pine, spruce, and many flowering plants] have antimicrobial benefits
- Phytosterols [from various pollens] aid in bee development.
- Quercetin and other flavonols [from many flowering plants] good.
- Eugenol from cloves and cinnamon has both antimicrobial and mite-repellent properties
- Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) from poplar buds has potent antifungal properties that help fight chalkbrood disease

Some beekeepers now plant "bee pharmacies" with medicinal plants like thyme, mint, eucalyptus, and sunflowers near apiaries to provide these beneficial compounds.

Bees seem to selectively forage on certain plants when colonies are under pathogen stress. Not sure if the game should model changing pathogen stress over time or just leave it to lifespan.

## Carrying capacity by resource

> a honey bee can carry up to 70 milligrams of nectar in a single trip, while it can only carry up to 25 milligrams of pollen or 40 milligrams of water.

# Types of bee

'caste' seems to be a more overarching term since there are only 3 castes.

The type of bee that a larvae becomes is determined (in part?) by the diet it is given. This certainly applies to winter bees and queens. But note that some specialisms are a matter of a bee's _age_.
I think a larva develops in a matter of days.
There are specialised sub-types of workers and of foragers.
There are 'winter bees' which are fatter, and which can live up to 6 months, where as a normal bee lives for about 6 weeks.
Foragers dedicate themselves to foraging from one type of a flower at a time. The colour of pollen / bee bread varies based on the flower focused on.

## Worker bee lifecycle

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey_bee#Life_cycle

- Nurse bee: cleans hive, feeds larvae using royal jelly from their glands (larvae later eat other stuff)
- Then, onto building comb cells. [Claude says middle-aged workers produce wax, build comb, store food, guard the entrance]
- Then, they do other in-colony tasks, including receiving deliveries from foragers, and guarding the hive.
- Graduate into a forager. Foragers communicate using dances.

There is a coarse-grained distinction among workers between 'house bees' (stage 1-3) and foragers.

"This division of labor isn't completely rigid though - bees can adapt and change roles based on colony needs and conditions."

## Appearance

Apparently it's visible to the human eye when a bee is laden with pollen.

## robbers, guards

When hives get desperate, they may turn to robbing honey from other hives. (Check if 'robber bee' is a specialised type.) For protection from this and
other intruders (from ants to mice to bears), hives station guard bees at the entrances. When an alarm is sounded (by pheromone), the whole hive may
turn into guard bees for defence. Hives also tend to have small entrances to minimise the investment in guards.

Defence against robbing increases the game-importance of sap collection. Guidance to beekeepers reads "Be vigilant and take steps to prevent robbing, such as closing up any cracks or gaps in the hives" and this can be re-purposed as player advice.

### "silent robbing"

Bees can mask their scents. "Silent robbing" occurs when robber bees learn to move slowly and adopt the chemical signature of the target hive. This allows them to bypass guards and steal resources without triggering an alarm response - essentially infiltrating rather than invading.

## 'honey-bound'

Is the term for when a hive gets too full of honey. Bees just keep on delivering honey/nectar, reducing the space available for the queen to lay eggs, and their instinctual response to the state of being honey-bound is to 'swarm' (split into separate hive).

# Fighting (low-level)

> The barbed stinger serves a crucial purpose for the worker bee: it allows her to defend the hive, but at the cost of her own life.

Head-butt or grapple
Bite
Release alarm pheromones to call reinforcements [implying that a valid low-level fighting strategy is outnumbering]

# Fighting (high-level)

Irl, bees can stage full-scale hive invasions, where one colony tries to take over another, to gain control of honey stores or the whole hive.

Or they can do 'usurpation swarms, where a small swarm with a queen will enter an established colony, kill the resident queen, and take over the workforce and resources. This is different from traditional robbing as the goal is to capture the entire colony infrastructure.

Resource blockades sometimes form when bees from a stronger colony will hover around the entrance of a weaker hive, preventing foragers from returning with nectar and pollen. This weakens the target colony over time without direct confrontation. When foragers from the weaker colony return with nectar or pollen, the blockading bees will intercept them and either:

- Physically harass them, causing them to drop their loads
- Force them to land and surrender their nectar
- Chase them away from their own hive entrance

So it mostly works by preventing the resources from getting back to the hive, weakening the hive over time! So it's a good early attack strategy, preparing the ground for later attacks.

Note, chatgpt says they can also blockade resources: https://chatgpt.com/c/67b60a23-f900-8013-8ef6-439abae87ddb and even without direct competition that bees may 'patrol the area', chase competitors.

## Usurpation swarm steps

https://claude.ai/chat/0e03bc83-808b-4d65-bfa0-bc92176e201e

1. The invading queen and her workers enter the target hive gradually, often during periods when guard bees are less vigilant (like during rainy weather or evening hours).
1. They may initially hide in peripheral areas of the hive while slowly acquiring the colony's scent.
1. When the usurping queen kills the resident queen, there's a brief period of confusion among the resident workers.
1. The usurping queen then begins releasing her own queen pheromones throughout the hive. These pheromones are remarkably powerful—they inhibit worker ovary development, regulate worker behavior, and essentially "reprogram" the colony.
1. Within just 1-2 days of the resident queen's death, the worker bees accept the new queen primarily because they respond to the presence of queen pheromones, not to the specific identity of their queen.
1. The combined workforce (invaders plus original residents) then functions as a single colony under the new leadership.


# Swarming: the hive splits up if runs out of room

# Seasonality

76% of new colonies in some sample died in their first winter (mostly due to starvation) - Honeybee Democracy

Seems like the game could easily incorporate a seasonality element, given the existence of winter bees (see 'types of bee'). This would encourage
play styles where you have to make sure you bank enough honey to survive the winter.
See blog post from wildflowermeadow.com about the differences between seasons.

Weather can affect things, via affecting the amount of pollen available. Or I suppose foraging could be rained off.

There are complex effects of seasonality:
> Pollen is only available during certain times of the year, and it is not always available in large quantities
> Water is also not always available, especially in dry climates.
> Nectar, on the other hand, is available year-round and in most climates.

So a rainstorm is bad in the immediate term, because it rains off foraging, but good in the longer term, because it creates pools for bees to collect water from, and it encourages flowers to grow.

# Queen death

> In response to the queen’s demise, the worker bees initiate the emergency queen rearing process. They select a few worker bee larvae, typically between five and eight days old, and begin feeding them royal jelly, a special nutrient-rich food that is typically reserved for the queen. This special diet stimulates the larvae’s development and transforms them into potential queens.
> In some cases, the emergency queen rearing process may fail, and the colony may become queenless. In these situations, beekeeper intervention may be necessary to save the hive.

# Interesting

book 'Honeybee Democracy' makes the point that a hive full of bees and a human brain weigh about the same, and there are similarities between how neuron firings and bee stuff are the underlying agents that make up decision-making (both situations involve meeting a threshold)

A colony can be viewed as a superorganism or as a society. Superorganism view might promote a more coarse-grained, automatic, groupy level of player control over the hive; society view more fine-grained. If we use the former way of doing things, then the game could even be called Superorganism.

Also from this book I learn that shortly after winter solstice hives begin to lay eggs again (into the spaces left by used up honey). So there is an interesting strategy question for players to work out of when to start paying down their honey stores in order to 'get a head start' for the next year's competition.

# Waggle dances

Dances involve 'followers' who join in the dance.
The information dances encode are:
- The resource in question (which receiving bees pick up by smelling the dancer with their antennae, who I think does a little vomit or something to pass on the scent)
- The approximate direction of the resource
- The approximate distance (directionally proportional to the duration of the waggle phase)
Once at the location, recruited foragers then search about for the described bounty.
